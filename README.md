# Website Dev Annotator: AI Notes & Markdown Export

> **One-sentence pitch:** Alt + Right-Click any web element to annotate it, then export all your notes as clean Markdown for AI tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT.

---

## What it does

Dev Annotator lets you attach sticky-note annotations directly to HTML elements on any web page. When you're done, one click copies everything as structured Markdown — ready to paste into any AI coding assistant, bug tracker, or documentation tool.

**Use cases:**
- Briefing AI tools (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT) about which elements need changes and why
- Writing QA bug reports with exact element selectors
- Taking design-review notes directly on a live site
- Annotating UI for handoff or code review

---

## Features

### Free
- **Alt + Right-Click** gesture annotates any element — captures tag, ID, classes, XPath, URL, and your note
- Unlimited annotations, grouped by page URL in the popup
- Per-row inline note editing (auto-saves as you type)
- Per-row delete button — moves annotation to history rather than erasing it
- **Copy All as Markdown** — one-click export of all notes in a clean, AI-ready format
- **🕐 History view** — last 30 deleted annotations with timestamps, including restore
- **Copy Log** — last 10 "Copy All as Markdown" events with full output preview
- Annotations persist in `chrome.storage.local` across page reloads and browser restarts
- Inline panel on the page — edit or delete annotations without opening the popup

### Premium — $9.99 one-time
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — a polished dark theme for the popup
- 📝 **Custom prepend & append text** — automatically wrap every Markdown export with your own headers, footers, or AI system prompts
- 📋 **Unlimited history** — full copy log and annotation history, no cap
- 🚀 **All future premium features**

## How it works

1. **Annotate** — On any page, hold `Alt` (or `Option` on Mac) and **Right-Click** any element. A panel opens where you type a note. It auto-saves as you type.
2. **Review** — Click the extension icon in the toolbar to see all saved annotations grouped by page URL. Notes are editable inline.
3. **Copy** — Click **Copy All as Markdown** to copy a clean, structured payload to the clipboard.
4. **History** — Click 🕐 to browse past annotations, including deleted ones, with timestamps. Click `+` to restore any entry.
5. **Settings** — Click ⚙ to toggle dark mode (Premium), configure prepend/append text (Premium), or enter a license key.

## Example output

```markdown
## https://example.com/dashboard

1. `button#submit-btn` → Make this button larger and change color to green
2. `div.sidebar` | `body/div[2]/div[1]` → Reduce width to 200px and add a top border
```

Paste directly into Cursor's chat, Claude, or any AI tool — it already knows which element, where it lives, and what you want changed.

## Installation

### From the Chrome Web Store *(coming soon)*
Search **"Dev Annotator"** in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com) and click **Add to Chrome**.

### Manual (Developer / Sideloaded)
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/asharma2027/ai-dev-annotator.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned folder

## Activating Premium

1. Purchase a license key on Gumroad *(link coming soon)*
2. Gumroad will email you a license key
3. Open the extension popup → click ⚙ (Settings) → paste your key in the **Premium** section → click **Activate**
4. Your license is stored locally and validated against Gumroad's API

> **Keep your license key safe** — it's stored in `chrome.storage.local`. If you clear extension data, you'll need to re-enter it (the key itself remains valid indefinitely).

---

## Privacy

Dev Annotator stores all annotation data **locally** in your browser via `chrome.storage.local`. No data is sent to any server unless you activate a license key, at which point only the key is sent to Gumroad's API to verify validity. No browsing history, page content, or personal data is ever collected or transmitted.

## For developers: local development

To develop and test new premium features locally:

1. Open `popup.js` and set `DEV_MODE = true` at the top of the file
2. All premium features will be unlocked and a dev indicator appears in Settings
3. **Never commit with `DEV_MODE = true`** — this bypasses all license checks

The `DEV_MODE` constant is intentionally left in the source so you can continue building new gated features without needing a valid license in your local environment. Set it back to `false` before committing and publishing.
